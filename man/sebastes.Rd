\title{Microhaplotype data from kelp rockfish \emph{Sebastes atrovirens}}
\format{
This tibble includes 825 alleles/haplotypes from 165 genomic regions and
is in the format of \code{\link{long_markers}}. However since true positions
of these markers in the genome are not known, it is instructive to see from these data
how to insert them into the format of \code{\link{long_markers}}.  Simply the column
\code{Chrom} simply has "GTseq" in it, denoting that these are markers obtained from
a GTseq procedure.  \code{Locus} has the name of each locus in it.  The column
\code{Pos} has a simple index for each locus.  They don't denote genomic positions, but they
are useful for sorting things if you run the data through \code{\link{reindex_markers}}.  The
\code{Allele} column gives the sequences of each allele/haplotype observed in the population.

\description{
These are data from 165 amplicons sequenced in two different runs of an Illumina
MiSeq machine at the SWFSC lab in Santa Cruz.  Genotypes of roughly 150 individuals
were called an resolved into haplotypes using the fact that each short read comes
from a single chromosome.
