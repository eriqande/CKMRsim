\arguments{
\item{Q}{the Qij object that is the output of simulate_Qij.}

\item{nu}{the name of the relationship that is in the \strong{nu}merator
of the likelihood ratio (Lambda) whose distribution you wish to learn about.
It is a string, for example "FS", or "PO", or "U".  The Q values for that
relationship must be included in parameter Q.  If this is a vector, then
all different values are used in combination with all the values of
\code{de}, \code{tr}, and, possibly, \code{pstar}. Corresponds to column "numerator" in the output}

\item{de}{the relationship that appears in the \strong{de}nominator of Lambda.
By default it is "U".  Corresponds to column "denominator" in the output. If it
is a vector, then all values are done iteratively in combination with other values as
described for \code{nu}.}

\item{tr}{the true relationship of the pairs. Default is "U". (i.e. you are going to
get samples of Lambda under their distribution when the true relationship is tr).
Operates over all values if a vector. Corresponds to column "true_relat" in the
output.}

\item{method}{the Monte Carlo method to use.  Either "IS" for importance sampling,
"vanilla" for vanilla Monte Carlo---regular Monte Carlo without importance sampling---or
or "both". The method that was used for any row of the output is reported in the
column "mc_method".}

\item{pstar}{the relationship used for the importance sampling distribution.
If set as NA and importance sampling (method == "IS" or "both") is used, then
the value of \code{nu} is used as need be.  If not NA, then this can be a vector
of relationships.  Each value will be used in all combinations of pstar, nu, de, and tr.
This is reported in column "pstar" in the output. For the vanilla method this is
actually set to the be denominator for each lambda.}

\item{FNRs}{the false negative rates at which to evaluate the false positive rates.
These are reported in column "fnr" in the output. These should all be between
0 and 1.  By default fnr is c(0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001).}

\item{Q_for_fnrs}{The Qij struct to use to compute the Lambda values corresponding to the
given FNRs. This is used primarily for the situation where you are importance sampling with
truth = Unrelated and doing physically linked markers.}

\item{lambda_stars}{Additional values of lambda to consider as cutoffs.  The corresponding
false negative rates will be computed for each of these and will be presented in the output.}
}
\value{
A long format data frame.  It will have a column of \code{tot_loci} that gives the total
number of loci.
}
\description{
Once you have gotten an object of class Qij from \code{\link{simulate_Qij}} you can pass that
to this function along with instructions on what quantities to compute.
This version assumes that the denominator of Lambda and the true relationship can be specified as a
a simple, single
relationship (typically, and by default, "U"), rather than a mixture of
possible relationships. Code for the latter has not yet been implemented.
}
\details{
The output is a long format data frame.
