\title{A long format way of specifying markers.}
\format{
A data frame with necessary columns:
\describe{
\item{Chrom}{The name of the chromosome.  This should always be an integer (or maybe "X" or "Y")}
\item{Locus}{The name of the locus.  This can be any string.}
\item{Pos}{The position of the locus in \emph{bases} along the chromosome.}
\item{Allele}{The name of allele.  Any string is OK}
\item{Freq}{The frequency of the allele in the population}
\item{AlleIdx}{The index of the allele.  These have to go from 1 up to the number of
alleles at the locus.  Order is immaterial. }
\item{LocIdx}{The index of the locus within the chromosome.  This goes from 1 up to the
number of loci on the chromosome.  These should be ordered according to Pos}

}

\usage{

\description{
This is a tibble that provides an example of how to
specify markers.  This is particularly useful for pumping stuff into Mendel.
And it is way easier than having everything in a big named list.
