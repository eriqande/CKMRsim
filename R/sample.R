# proportions, it prints them as they are
# @param R the relationship.
# @param colchars What characters should go between then relationships in the formatting
# @examples
# format_mixed_r(c(U=.9997, FS=.0001, PO=.00001, HS=.0002))

## This is the importance sampling workhorse function...
# Q is for Qvals, nu is the relationship in the numerator of lambda,
# de is the relationship in the denominator of lambda which always be
# U in the current context, tr is the true
# relationship, which will typically be taken to be "U" in these
# contexts, and pstar is the relationship of the importance sampling
# distribution, which in this context will almost always by nu.
# FNRs are the false negative rates you want to investigate.
# In some cases you might want to specify the Lambda_Star cutoffs
# instead of the FNRs.  You can do that, too---just specify those
# lambda_star values as a vector and they will be added to the
# lambda_star values used by the FNRs.  desired_FPRs are values of FPRs
# for which you would like to know the lambdas and FNRs

#### EXPORTED FUNCTIONS #####
#' sample Q values to get and analyze a sample of Lambdas with simple (non-mixture) hypotheses
#'
#' Once you have gotten an object of class Qij from \code{\link{simulate_Qij}} you can pass that
#' to this function along with instructions on what quantities to compute.
#' This version assumes that the denominator of Lambda and the true relationship can be specified as a
#' a simple, single
#' relationship (typically, and by default, "U"), rather than a mixture of
#' possible relationships. Code for the latter has not yet been implemented.
#'
#' The output is a long format data frame.
#' @param Q the Qij object that is the output of simulate_Qij.
#' @param nu the name of the relationship that is in the \strong{nu}merator
#' of the likelihood ratio (Lambda) whose distribution you wish to learn about.
#' It is a string, for example "FS", or "PO", or "U".  The Q values for that
#' relationship must be included in parameter Q.  If this is a vector, then
#' all different values are used in combination with all the values of
#' \code{de}, \code{tr}, and, possibly, \code{pstar}. Corresponds to column "numerator" in the output
#' @param de the relationship that appears in the \strong{de}nominator of Lambda.
#' By default it is "U".  Corresponds to column "denominator" in the output. If it
#' is a vector, then all values are done iteratively in combination with other values as
#' described for \code{nu}.
#' @param tr the true relationship of the pairs. Default is "U". (i.e. you are going to
#' get samples of Lambda under their distribution when the true relationship is tr).
#' Operates over all values if a vector. Corresponds to column "true_relat" in the
#' output.
#' @param method the Monte Carlo method to use.  Either "IS" for importance sampling,
#' "vanilla" for vanilla Monte Carlo---regular Monte Carlo without importance sampling---or
#' or "both". The method that was used for any row of the output is reported in the
#' column "mc_method".
#' @param pstar the relationship used for the importance sampling distribution.
#' If set as NA and importance sampling (method == "IS" or "both") is used, then
#' the value of \code{nu} is used as need be.  If not NA, then this can be a vector
#' of relationships.  Each value will be used in all combinations of pstar, nu, de, and tr.
#' This is reported in column "pstar" in the output. For the vanilla method this is
#' actually set to the be denominator for each lambda.
#' @param FNRs the false negative rates at which to evaluate the false positive rates.
#' These are reported in column "fnr" in the output. These should all be between
#' 0 and 1.  By default fnr is c(0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001).
#' @param lambda_stars Additional values of lambda to consider as cutoffs.  The corresponding
#' false negative rates will be computed for each of these and will be presented in the output.
#' @param Q_for_fnrs The Qij struct to use to compute the Lambda values corresponding to the
#' given FNRs. This is used primarily for the situation where you are importance sampling with
#' truth = Unrelated and doing physically linked markers.
#' @return A long format data frame.  It will have a column of \code{tot_loci} that gives the total
#' number of loci.
