## Prerequisites

In order to pursue simulations in the face of physical linkage, you must download
and install the external dependency, Mendel version 16.  For Windows and Mac OS X, 
CKMRsim will look for the Mendel binary in its default install location. So download
it from [http://software.genetics.ucla.edu/mendel](http://software.genetics.ucla.edu/mendel) and do a default install.
Note that you need to register with your email in order to download Mendel.

## An Example

'CKMRsim' comes with an example data set of linked markers.  The data themselves are concocted---they are merely
the microhaplotypes that have been assigned some fictitious positions within a genome---but that is useful for
demonstration. The data are allele frequencies in the format required by 'CKMRsim'. Here are the first few
lines of them"
```{r}
linked_mhaps
```
See that each marker is given a position (in base pairs) along the chromosome upon which it resides.

By default, 'CKMRsim' assumes a simple recombination rate of 1 cM per megabase.  If you have an actual
genetic linkage map for you markers, then you can accommodate that by giving base-pair positions (`Pos`)
of the markers that correspond to the positions that would yield the observed recombination fractions
under a constant rate of 1 cM/Mb.

Here we will show the process of simulating full sibling pairs with and without the physical linkage
in `linked_mhaps`.  We will also show that physical linkage does not affect parent-offspring or
unrelated pairs.

## Simulating Pairs

Creating the CKMR object is just the same as it was in the "Example 1" vignette.
```{r}
ck_lmh <- create_ckmr(
  D = linked_mhaps,
  kappa_matrix = kappas[c("PO", "FS", "U"), ],
  ge_mod_assumed = ge_model_TGIE,
  ge_mod_true = ge_model_TGIE,
  ge_mod_assumed_pars_list = list(epsilon = 0.01),
  ge_mod_true_pars_list = list(epsilon = 0.01)
)
```

Simulating the markers under the assumption of no linkage is also the same:
```{r}
Qs_lmh_no_link <- simulate_Qij(ck_lmh,
                               calc_relats = c("PO", "FS", "U"),
                               sim_relats = c("PO", "FS", "U") 
                               )
```


In order to simulate the markers with physical linkage, you use the same
`simulate_Qij()` function, but you tell it to simulate with physical linkage
_and_ you also have to give it a list of pedigrees so that it can pass the
correct pedigrees to the program MENDEL, which actually does the simulation.
`CKMRsim` comes with such a list. At the moment, it only has three entries"
"PO", FS", "HS".  If you want to add more (like cousins) feel free.  Just note
that the two focal individuals of the pair have to be individuals 1 and 2.  
If you need help, ping me at [eric.anderson@noaa.gov](mailto:eric.anderson@noaa.gov).

So, simulating with linkage looks like this:
```{r, eval=DoMendel}
# we only run this if it is on eric's laptop.  This way
# we can build the vignette even on CRAN's machines that don't
# have Mendel installed
Qs_lmh_with_link <- simulate_Qij(ck_lmh,
                                 calc_relats = c("PO", "FS", "U"),
                                 sim_relats = c("PO", "FS", "U"), 
                                 unlinked = FALSE,
                                 pedigree_list = pedigrees
)

```


Note that `CKMRsim` is wise enough to simply simulate markers as unlinked for the
PO, U, and MZ cases (because, when dealing with pairs with those relationships,
the presence of physical linkage makes no difference to the outcome).


Carrying on, it is instructive to look at the distributions of the FS/U log-likelihood
ratios.  They should differ between the cases with and without linkage, most notably the case
with linkage should produce values with greater variance.  Let us see if that
is the case. To do that, we extract the log-likelihood ratio values, put them together
in a single data frame, and then plot them.  Note that the `extract_logls` function
returns a column that says whether the simulation was done with or without linkage, so
it is straightforward to do this in two lines:
```{r, eval=DoMendel}
lnl_logls <- list(
  extract_logls(Qs_lmh_no_link, numer = c(FS = 1), denom = c(U = 1)),
  extract_logls(Qs_lmh_with_link, numer = c(FS = 1), denom = c(U = 1))
) %>%
  bind_rows()
```
```{r, eval=DoMendel, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
saveRDS(lnl_logls, file = "data/lnl_logls.rds")
```
```{r, eval=NoDoMendel, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
lnl_logls <- readRDS("data/lnl_logls.rds")
```

Now compare the cases when the truth is full-sibling:
```{r, fig.width = 7}
lnl_logls %>%
  filter(true_relat == "FS") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = logl_ratio, fill = simtype)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 70, 
                 position = position_identity(),
                 alpha = 0.5)
```


See, logl ratios have the same mean top and bottom.

```{r}
lnl_logls %>%
  filter(true_relat == "FS") %>%
  group_by(simtype) %>%
  summarise(mean_logl_rat = mean(logl_ratio),
            mean_numer = mean(numer_logl))
```
